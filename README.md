# To do next!

1. add more content in there, maybe have a blog post area where u yap about your daily life (but do it at external blog site)
2. refine the aesthetic (background color and scroll logic (rn if u scroll up animation doesnt work))
3. upload shit ton of stuff to your github
4. update your resume and put it there
5. put your linkedin here as well
6. deploy it

this could actually work!!!
